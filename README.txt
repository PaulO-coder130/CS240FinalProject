All instructions are implemented in my code, to run and use them in MIPS download the custom language maker used for the assignment, drag the MarioGalaxyLanguage.java file to MARSLE->mars->mips->instructions->customLangs, and use the command prompt to add the language to MARS as seen in the tutorial. Then use the language switcher to be able to use my code or any custom code using my commands. I have also turned in part 1 of the project so you can see which commands are available and how to use them.
